# Computer Networks for Big Data

The projects in this repository were created while working on the course Computer Networks for Big Data for my postgraduate studies. They include the following:

1. **DCN Traffic Analysis**: analyze network traffic in data centers based on trace in PCAP format and extract traffic characteristics in the form of distributions.

2. **Flow Migration**: implement a technique for transferring a network flow to another path of a network topology and evaluate any complications in communication, such as increased delay, packet losses and change of packet arrival order. The transfer of the flow is done using OpenFlow.
